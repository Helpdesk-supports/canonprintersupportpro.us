<li><span><i class="“fa" aria-hidden="“true”"></i></span>If the WPS push button is not available, use the instructions in the Standard Connection Method section</li>
<li><span><i class="“fa" aria-hidden="“true”"></i></span>Your network must be using either WPA (Wi-Fi Protected Access) or WPA2 security protocol. Most WPS enabled access points use this protocol</li>

</ul>
<h3><strong>Network Settings Confirmation</strong></h3>

<ul>
<li><span><i class="“fa" aria-hidden="“true”"></i></span>Make sure that your printer is turned on</li>
<li><span><i class="“fa" aria-hidden="“true”"></i></span>Load a sheet of A4 sized plain paper into the paper tray</li>
