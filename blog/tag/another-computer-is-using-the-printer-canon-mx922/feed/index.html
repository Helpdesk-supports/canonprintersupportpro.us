Simply work your way down the list until you discover one that suits your needs.</p>
<p>Several Windows customers have contacted us with inquiries after seeing that <strong>Another computer is using the printer</strong> error message when attempting to shut down or restart their machine. The majority of impacted individuals claim that the problem persists even when they try to log in with a different user account. As it turns out, the problem isn&#8217;t limited to Windows 10, as it also affects Windows 8.1.</p>
<h2><strong>What causes the warning &#8220;Someone else is still using this PC&#8221;?</strong></h2>
<p>We looked into this issue by looking at many user complaints and attempting various repair procedures that other afflicted users have proposed for the issue of <strong>Another computer is using the printer Canon MX922 or Another computer is using the printer Canon mg3600</strong>.

<ul>
<li><span><i class="fa fa-circle" aria-hidden="true"></i></span>A Sign-in Option is to blame for the problem. As it turns out, the problem is caused by an option in the Sign-in Options menu that causes the computer to utilize the sign-in information to finish setting up the device and reopen programs automatically.</li>
<li><span><i class="fa fa-circle" aria-hidden="true"></i></span>Another option is that the previous user that used this PC did not finish the logoff procedure. This might happen as a result of a machine failure or a human desire. In this instance, you&#8217;ll need to utilize Task Manager to detach the prior user to resolve the problem.</li>
</ul>
<h3><strong>Fix 1: Restart your computer&#8217;s Printer Spooler service.</strong></h3>
<p>The Printer Spooler service on your computer may be halted, resulting in the <strong>Another computer is using the printer Canon </strong>problem. Follow these instructions to restart the Printer Spooler service on your computer:</p>

<li><span><i class="fa fa-circle" aria-hidden="true"></i></span>Exit out of the Services window.</li>
</ol>
<p>Re-connect the printer.</p>

<h2><strong>Fix 2: Remove the prior user&#8217;s connection.</strong></h2>
<p>As it turns out, this issue of <strong>Another computer is using the printer</strong> can also be caused by a prior user&#8217;s log-off being incomplete. Several Windows customers who were having the same difficulty claimed that they were able to solve the problem by disconnecting the user who was blocking the shutdown or restarting the operation from completing using Task Manager.</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s a brief tutorial to utilize Task Manager to disconnect the prior user:</p>

<li><span><i class="fa fa-circle" aria-hidden="true"></i></span>Select the Users tab from the horizontal menu at the top once you&#8217;re within the Task Manager interface.</li>
<li><span><i class="fa fa-circle" aria-hidden="true"></i></span>Then, in the User list, right-click on the user who is no longer logged in and select Disconnect from the context menu that appears.</li>
<li><span><i class="fa fa-circle" aria-hidden="true"></i></span>Removing the previous user&#8217;s connection</li>
</ul>
<p>Try to repeat the activity that caused the &#8216;Someone else is still using this PC&#8217; message to appear.</p>
