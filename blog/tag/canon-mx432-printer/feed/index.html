If your printer is unable to make a connection with the router, then try another method to reconnect them.</p>
<h2 style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Cause 1: If you haven’t removed the protective material or tape from any part of the </strong><strong>Canon Mx432.</strong></h2>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">While opening and unpacking the new printer.It from a few parts, this happens more with the new users when they don’t know completely about the printer.</p>

<h2 style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Case 2: Do not turn off the power button while printing.</strong></h2>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">Another thing that you need to make sure that is- never turn off the power button while the machine is still in the process of printing or sending/ receiving the fax.
