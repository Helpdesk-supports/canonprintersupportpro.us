<h3><strong>Suitable Guidelines To Prevent Paper Jam Error In Canon Printer</strong></h3>

<li>There is a sliding mechanism that allows different types and sizes of paper to be fed into the Canon Printer.</li>
<li>Use the standard size of paper for your Canon Printer to get quality printouts. Folded, smeared, labeled, and dirty paper may often cause paper jam issues as they have irregular dimensions. If you confuse regarding which types of paper Canon printer accepts, immediately contact printer documentation.</li>
<li>It is strongly recommended to not keep papers in the paper tray for a long period otherwise paper will be jammed.</li>
