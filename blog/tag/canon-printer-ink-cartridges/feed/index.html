										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Who doesn’t like to use their Canon printing devices to get exceptionally vibrant outputs? It is possible only when you use genuine </span><b>Canon printer ink cartridges</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">. The pigment-based ink and <a target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener" href="https://www.dpreview.com/forums/thread/4420000">ChromaLife ink</a> are best for printing text and photos, respectively. These inks produce bright colors and vivid printouts. However, many users are still unaware of the different kinds of cartridges the brand offers. This article will give you a detailed overview of Canon ink cartridges. It will solve all your queries about using the cartridges and replacing them. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span></p>
<h2><strong>Common Types of Canon Printer Ink Cartridges</strong></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There are primarily two types of Canon ink cartridges. These are the black and the tri-color ink cartridges. Both deliver crisp and quality print.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> These are also known as integrated printer cartridges due to a built-in printhead. Note that Canon printer models with both these ink cartridge sets, such as Canon PG-240 black and CL-261 color, are inexpensive. However, the cartridges themselves aren’t cheap. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A major problem people encounter is with the tri-color </span><b>Canon printer ink cartridge</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">. You need to replace the full cartridge if even one color reduces in quantity. It is the reason why most prefer using individual ink cartridges. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span></p>
<h2><strong>How do Single Canon Ink Printer Cartridges Differ from FINE Cartridges?</strong></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">A majority of Canon InkJet printers employ printhead technology. This technology is the FINE or full-photolithography InkJet nozzle engineering. This technology generates the best quality prints. The FINE printheads push the ink in one ejection, which enhances efficiency and greater ink droplet placement speeds. </span></i></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A </span><b>Canon Pixma printer ink cartridge </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">is usually a single ink cartridge. But some Pixma printers employ the FINE cartridge system. This system utilizes a black and tri-color ink cartridge. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The key difference between single </span><b>Canon ink printer cartridges </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">and FINE cartridges is that of convenience and maintenance time. In FINE cartridges, the printheads integrate into the cartridge. They are restored whenever you replace the cartridge. In contrast, Canon printers with a single cartridge for every ink make it difficult for you to have that convenience. But the single cartridges save you money over time because you only need to change the cartridge that has gone out of a single color ink.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">You will find most Canon cartridges in standard yield size. But some Pixma printers need XXL cartridges. Note that there’s no difference in installing different sizes of cartridges. The difference is only in ink inside the cartridge.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">XXL cartridge obviously has more ink than an XL cartridge. The high-yield cartridges are a bit costlier, but they serve you well for a prolonged time compared to the standard-yield cartridges. So, if you need to print high-quality outputs continuously, it&#8217;s better to invest in Canon high-yield cartridges.</span></p>

<li>If you print number of pages at a single time, do not mix the paper size. Make sure entire pages loaded in the input tray are in the same size. Generally, you are advised to take A-4 size plain white paper.</li>
<li>Make sure the stack of paper is correctly seated into the paper tray. Suppose a paper seated inappropriately, will surely cause a paper jamming issue. So, be aware while you attempting to load the papers into the slot.</li>

If you confuse regarding which types of paper Canon printer accepts, immediately contact printer documentation.</li>
<li>It is strongly recommended to not keep papers in the paper tray for a long period otherwise paper will be jammed.</li>
