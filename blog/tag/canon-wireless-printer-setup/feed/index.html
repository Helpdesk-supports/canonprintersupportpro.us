<h2><strong>Solution 3: Use High Quality Generic Cartridges</strong></h2>
<p>If you use low quality of generic cartridges, then there is a high chance of getting blank pages of printouts. So, you must use a high-quality generic cartridge. By using quality ink, you can receive great quality printouts and suitable viscosity, so that it will not block the print nozzles.</p>
<h2><strong>Solution 4: Make Sure The Printer Is Placed In Proper Position</strong></h2>
<p>It is highly recommended to the Canon printer users that place their printer in a suitable location because the ink on the printhead may get thicker when the printer is not been in used for a long time. Place the printer in a cool place to avoid further obstacles.</p>
<h2><strong>Solution 5: Check The Level Of Ink</strong></h2>
<p>You must check the ink level whether it is empty or low. You can easily check this by printing reports using the buttons on the printer menu. If there is no ink in the black cartridge, you can’t print anything. So, fill the black ink into the cartridges and then, proceed with the printing job.</p>
<h2><strong>Solution 6: Clean The Print Heads</strong></h2>
<p>If you are not using your Canon printer for a long period of time, then the ink may dry out and clog the printhead cartridges. To unclog the printhead, you need to clean the printheads or print nozzles. To do so, follow the below points:</p>
<ul>
<li><span><i class="fa fa-circle" aria-hidden="true"></i></span>First turn-off your Canon printer from the power button</li>
<li><span><i class="fa fa-circle" aria-hidden="true"></i></span>Now, remove the cartridge or ink container slightly from the printer</li>
<li><span><i class="fa fa-circle" aria-hidden="true"></i></span>Normally, protective sheets are placed in new cartridges. Find it and then, clean it with a cotton cloth or tissue</li>
