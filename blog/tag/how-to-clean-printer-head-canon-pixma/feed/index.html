<li><span><i class="fa fa-circle" aria-hidden="true"></i></span>Next, select the “Maintenance (tools)” icon.</li>
<li><span><i class="fa fa-circle" aria-hidden="true"></i></span>After that, click the “Cleaning” tab and then tap “Yes” when getting prompts.</li>
<li><span><i class="fa fa-circle" aria-hidden="true"></i></span>Now, the printer will start cleaning and continue the process for a minute.</li>
<li><span><i class="fa fa-circle" aria-hidden="true"></i></span>Once it’s done! Do command for a nozzle check test page to see if the cleaning has improved printing quality.</li>
</ul>
<p>If unfortunately, lines are missing or still receiving faded printouts, then this time, run a deep cleaning on the printer. The procedure for deep cleaning the printhead is similar as the regular cleaning above. The only change is clicking on the “Deep Cleaning” tab instead of selecting the “Cleaning” option. The printhead is cleaned after the completion of the deep cleaning process and hence, continue printing.</p>

<ul>
<li><span><i class="fa fa-circle" aria-hidden="true"></i></span>Then, carefully remove the Canon printhead from the carriage.</li>
<li><span><i class="fa fa-circle" aria-hidden="true"></i></span>Now, you’ll see the printhead nozzle on the back side of the printhead.</li>
