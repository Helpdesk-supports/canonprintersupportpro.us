                                <li>First, ensure that you have turned on the canon printer and connected to a working
                                    electricity socket.</li>
                                <li>Now go to your computer and open Printers &amp; Scanners. There see if your printer
                                    is listed or not. When you are trying to get the printout from your canon printer
                                    and you have already installed so many printers in the list, it can create confusion
                                    for the computer and maybe your printer left unrecognized.</li>
                                <li>So, delete other printers from the list and re-add your canon printer from the list.
                                </li>
                                <li>Check that your printer is connected with a high-speed network. A poor network can
                                    stop your printer to work properly.</li>
                                <li>Sometimes the printer stops working because of the paper jam issue as well. So,
                                    ensure there is nothing like this happened with your printer.</li>
                                <li>Open the printer’s setting and delete all the paused printing commands, multiple
                                    printing commands can also make your printer stop.</li>
                                <li>Turn off your printer and computer, wait for few minutes and turn both of them on.
                                </li>
                                <li>Now again try printing, these steps will surely rectify the issue.</li>

                                        this, because you may face some issue with print quality. Here is the guide to
                                        refill your canon printer’s cartridge
                                    </p>

                                    <p>Ensure that the ink cartridge you are trying to refill is empty. Remove the ink
                                        cartridge from the printer.</p>
                                    <p>You can purchase an ink refill kit of canon printer’s cartridge from the ink
                                        supply store.</p>
                                    <p>Collect a 30cc syringe along with a needle, ink to refill and a thumb drill.</p>
                                    <p>Remember to keep the ink cartridge on a paper towel while refilling. This will
                                        save your floor or table to get dirty if in case the ink leaked.</p>
                                    <p>Choose the ink color that you wish to refill into the respective cartridge.</p>
                                    <p>Choose the color you want to refill, and insert the needle to pull the respective
                                        color inside it.</p>
                                    <p>Now it’s time to locate the hole in the cartridge. Cover the exit hole with tape
                                        to avoid any leakage.</p>
                                    <p>Make a small hole in the ink cartridge using the thumb drill just behind the ink
                                        cartridge label.</p>
                                    <p>Push the ink inside the hole that you created in the ink cartridge.</p>
                                    <p>Now take the needle out of the cartridge and the container then place the top
                                        back on the ink so that it won’t spill around.</p>
                                    <p>Next, you have to remove the tape covering the sponge area and then reinstall the
                                        ink cartridges.</p>
